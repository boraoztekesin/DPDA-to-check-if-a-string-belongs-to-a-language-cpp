# DPDA-to-check-if-a-string-belongs-to-a-language-cpp
A program that simulates a 
DPDA(Deterministic Push-Down Automata). This automota will be 
used to check if a string is belonging to a specific language that is 
provided by input or not. And the program will be finished with writing 
the outcome of whether the given strings belong to the language or not 
to an output file.
